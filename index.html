            <h1>Full Stack Web Developer from Colorado, USA</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Dee. I love programming and going the extra mile to make something great.
                I have a background in Computer Information Systems, but most of what I've learned has been self-taught
                to account for the things that weren't taught in the classroom. I tackle challenges head-on, and I am 
                always striving to push myself to new heights.

            <h3>Social Media App</h3>
            <p>
                A full stack project called Flitter, which is a parody of a certain social media site named after the 24th letter 
                of the alphabet. Flitter is a web app with a separated frontend and backend; it offers client-side
                rendering and routing, and fetches data from the backend's API endpoints when needed. It offers several of the
                features that are included in the social media site it's parodying, such as writing posts, liking posts, following
                people, and so on. Many different technologies were used to build this app, including React, Node.js, Postgres, and so on.

        <div>
            <img src="public/screenshots/members_only.PNG" width="400" height="400"/>
            <h3>Members Only Message Board</h3>
            <p>
                A backend project where users can create an account to post messages on a forum. 
                After creating an account, users can become special members if they enter a secret passcode. 
                Members have the unique ability to view the author and date of each post, whereas non-members can't. 
                This project was built using Node.js, EJS, Passport.JS, and uses session cookies for login purposes.

            <h3>LOTR Inventory App/Database</h3>
            <p>
                A backend project that lets you perform CRUD operations on a database dedicated to The Lord of the Rings (LOTR), 
                written by J.R.R. Tolkien. The data you can work with is based off of races, characters, and realms from 
                The Lord of the Rings. This project was built using Node.js, EJS, and several other technologies, and uses
                server-side rendering.

        <div>
            <img src="public/screenshots/shopping_cart.png" width="400" height="400"/>
            <h3>Shopping Cart</h3>
            <p>
                A frontend project that simulates an online store where you can add items to a shopping cart. You can choose
                the quantity of each product that you would like to your cart, or you can remove items from your cart as well. 
                React keeps track of all your cart items, and React Router lets you navigate the site as a single-page application (SPA).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img src="public/screenshots/memory_card.PNG" width="400" height="400"/>
            <h3>Memory Card Game</h3>
            <p>
                A frontend project based on a memory game. The game starts you off with 12 different cards, all of which are
                references to weapons found in "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild". (No worries if you don't know what
                Breath of the Wild is, you'll still be able to play the game.) Your task is to select each card exactly once,
                remembering which ones you've already picked beforehand. If you pick a card that you've already selected before,
                it's game over. This project was built using React, and images are fetched from the Hyrule Compendium API.
            </p>

        <div>
            <img src="public/screenshots/resume_builder.PNG" width="400" height="400"/>
            <h3>CV/Resume Builder</h3>
            <p>
                A frontend project that lets you create your own basic resume. You may include things like your work history and 
                education, with the ability to add multiple entries for each. After submitting the form, React remembers what you 
                entered, so you can go back and edit any details you'd like. However, none of the data you enter is retained in 
                a database as this is a frontend-only project.
